# Job-Borad-Website

1 Plan the project: Determine the goals and requirements of your job board website. Consider the features you want to include, such as job postings, resume submission, company profiles, and a job search function.

2 Design and Develop the frontend: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the layout and design of your website. You can use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Bulma to help you with the styling.

3 Adding interactivity: Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your website. For example, you can use JavaScript to implement a job search function that allows users to filter jobs by various criteria.

4 Connecting to a back-end: To store job listings and resume data and to handle user authentication, you will need to connect your website to a back-end. You can use a JavaScript framework such as Node.js to build the back-end and connect to a database such as MySQL or MongoDB.

5 Testing and debugging: Test your website to make sure it is working correctly and debug any errors.

6 Deploy the website: Once your website is ready to go live, you will need to deploy it to a web server.
